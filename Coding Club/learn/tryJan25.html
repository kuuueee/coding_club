    <ul>
        <li>A header, much like the one here that says: Annunciation Coding Club</li>
        <br>
        <li>A nice picture from the annunciation school media bank</li>
        <br>
        <li>A list, like this one.</li>
        <br>
        <li>A short paragraph that means what is says, and says what it means.</li>
        <br>
        <li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin">hyperlink</a> that takes you to a real live website</li>
    </ul>
