    <p>These are some of the things that I like about Penguins:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea</li>
        <li>The are distantly related to puffins</li>
        <li>Penguins for the most part breed in large colonies</li>
        <li>Penguins generally only lay one brood</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I just listed some facts, but don't take my word for it. Check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin">wikipedia</a> page about them.</p>
